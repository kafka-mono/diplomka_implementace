# System tests
The system tests are based on two kinds of analysis:
- Analysing screenshots made by the driver while no extensions and combinations of extensions are installed. Analysis is done based on captured pixels.
- Analyzing log files supplied by the browser. Log data is gathered while browsing using no installed extensions and while browsing with combinations of extensions installed.

This mechanism is based on the original integration tests implemented in thesis [Automatic testing of JavaScript Restrictor project](https://www.vut.cz/studenti/zav-prace/detail/129897).
